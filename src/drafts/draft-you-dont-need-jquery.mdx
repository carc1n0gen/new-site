Before I get in to it, I do want to acknowledge that I know the main reason new
web developers start using jQuery is due to the sheer amount of examples all
over the web that demonstrate how to perform DOM manipulation using it. My goal
with this post is to be one tiny little push away from that ðŸ˜Š.

## Element Selecting

One common thing people do with jQuery is select, or "query" the DOM to find an
element or many elements.

```js
// ======
// jQuery
// ======
const element = $(".myClass");

// ========
// plain js
// ========
const element = document.querySelector(".myClass"); // get single matching element
const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".myClass"); // get all matching elements
```

Now if all you are used to is jQuery, then those functions might seem quite
verbose. It is, but you get used to it, or you can alias it.

```js
// ========
// plain js
// ========
const qs = document.querySelector;
const qsa = document.querySelectorAll;

const element = qs(".myClass"); // get single matching element
const elements = qsa(".myClass"); // get all matching elements
```

## Event Handlers

Another common use for jQuery is to quickly add event handlers to buttons, forms
or other elements.

```js
// ======
// jQuery
// ======
$("#myButton").click(() => {
  alert("I've been clicked!");
});

$("#myForm").submit(() => {
  alert("I've been submitted!");
});

// ========
// plain js
// ========
document.querySelector("#myButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("I've been clicked!");
});

document.querySelector("#myForm").addEventListener("submit", () => {
  alert("I've been submitted!");
});
```

or if you use the alias shown previously:

```js
// ========
// plain js
// ========
const qs = document.querySelector;
qs("#myButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("I've been clicked!");
});

qs("#myForm").addEventListener("submit", () => {
  alert("I've been submitted!");
});
```

## Ajax calls

Now this is probably the #1 most common thing I see people using jQuery for. I
have even seen people include jQuery in their app for the _soul_ purpose of
performing Ajax requests. This is because the old `XMLHttpRequest` was not at
all intuitive to use, but modern JavaScript has a new api!

```js
// ======
// jQuery
// ======
$.ajax({
  method: "POST",
  url: "/some/endpoint",
  dataType: "json",
  data: { foo: "bar" },
})
  .then((data) => {
    // handle success
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // handle error
  });

// ========
// plain js
// ========
fetch("/some/endpoint", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ foo: "bar" }),
})
  .then((response) => {
    if (response.ok) {
      // handle success
    }
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // handle error
  });
```

Again, this is slightly more verbose in some ways, but I have always felt it is
better to be just a bit more verbose than include an entire library to do such
basic things.
