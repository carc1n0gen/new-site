Also on a side note: gosh it's been ages since I bothered to touch this site,
let alone write a new post. Migrating to NextJS was a nice exercise in learning
the framework, and a way to bring enthusiasm about it back. I hope to keep it up
and keep posting.

## So What Were Those Hurdles?

One of those hurdles was how NextJS (or maybe React in general?) deal with the
virtual DOM and changes made from outside scripts. Next will raise am error if
elements appear in the DOM that it was not expecting. Another issue I ran in to
was related to dark/light mode. When I migrated to NextJS, I decided I would
also implement a dark mode. When you initialize google reCaptcha, you can pass
a theme option, but this is only set once and is probably not meant to change.

## The Virtual DOM Hurdle

So in a plain html/js web page, you use google reCaptcha something like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>reCAPTCHA demo: Simple page</title>
    <script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form action="?" method="POST">
      <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="your_site_key"></div>
      <br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

What happens here is once the reCaptcha script is loaded, it looks for an
element with the class `g-recaptcha` and injects additional things within it.
This causes unexpected nodes to be detected by NextJS and an error is thrown.
Luckily there is a package that wraps this functionality in a React component to
avoid this sort of error. The package is called [react-google-recaptcha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-recaptcha)
and is used something like this:

```js
import ReCAPTCHA from "react-google-recaptcha";

export default function MyForm() {
  return (
    <form action="?" method="POST">
      <ReCAPTCHA sitekey="your_site_key" />
      <br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

With this, the reCaptcha is loaded, and now works just like before!

## The Dynamically Changing Theme Hurdle

I wanted the reCaptcha to automatically change between dark and light based on
the system settings of the user. There are media queries in CSS for changing the
look based on this preference, but how the heck does one detect this preference
with JavaScript? Well I found a fancy function called `matchMedia` which is used
for detecting if anything matches a CSS selector. On top of this, we can use
an event listener to detect if weather the selector matches ever change like so:

```js
matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").addEventListener(
  "change",
  (event) => {
    if (e.target.matches) {
      // Changed to dark mode
    } else {
      // Changed to light mode
    }
  },
);
```

The `ReCAPTCHA` component accepts a `theme` prop for choosing weather the
captcha should look dark or light. I tried using a state variable in combination
with a useEffect hook and the above event handler to update the theme whenever
the system theme changes like this:

```js
export default function MyForm() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("dark");

  useEffect(() => {
    // You can use matchMedia to detect if dark mode is enabled, and listen
    // for when it changes.
    const handler = matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").addEventListener(
      "change",
      (e) => {
        if (e.target.matches) {
          setTheme("dark");
        } else {
          setTheme("light");
        }
      },
    );

    // use the cleanup function to remove the event listener.
    return function cleanup() {
      matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").removeEventListener(
        "change",
        handler,
      );
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <form action="?" method="">
      <ReCAPTCHA sitekey="your_site_key" theme={theme} />
      <br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

But this will not update the reCaptcha theme since it is meant to be initialized
just once and then stay in that state. However react has a way to force a
component to re-mount, which will re-run all the stuff that happens within the
component. All components can be passed a `key` prop. If this key ever changes,
then the component it is passed to will re-mount. So I can use an additional
state variable for this key, and modify its value every time our theme change
handler is run:

```js
export default function MyForm() {
  const [key, setKey] = useState(0); // Our new key state variable
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("dark");

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").addEventListener(
      "change",
      (e) => {
        if (e.target.matches) {
          setTheme("dark");
        } else {
          setTheme("light");
        }

        // update the key's value
        setKey(key + 1);
      },
    );

    return function cleanup() {
      matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").removeEventListener(
        "change",
        handler,
      );
    };
  }, [key]); // Don't forget to add key to the dependency array

  return (
    <form action="?" method="">
      <ReCAPTCHA sitekey="your_site_key" theme={theme} />
      <br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

Now the reCaptcha theme changes dynamically when the system colour theme
changes!

This was just one of the many things I ran in to during my adventure of migrating
my blog to NextJS, and using NextJS to generate a static website. Stay tuned
for more!
